# Distance-to-Side-of-Square---MonteCarlo
Monte Carlo calculation to estimate the following problem :

A unit Square ABCD exists, and a point is randomly chosen within the square.

What is the probability that the point is closer to AB rather than BC or CD - the distance from the point to the line DA 
can be ignored.

The code as given executes 1,000,000 trials and uses matplotlib to draw a 3 colour region based on the trials.

With 1 million trials the code normally gives the correct value of 0.375 (to three decimal places).
